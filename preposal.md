# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have a few different ideas but haven't decided on one yet:
-A website or program that has a user pick their mood and a genre they like and their tv network and give them a show recommendation as a result
-A hangman game that randomizes the word and has a timer to guessing/inputting a letter

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No I am not working with anyone else

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Which project/idea do you think would be better to do?
